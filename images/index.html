	<h1>Windsurfing</h1>

	<p>Windsurfing is an extreme watersport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. The key equipment for windsurfing includes a board, mast, boom, and sail. The size of the board and sail vary depending on the skill of the rider and weather conditions.</p>

	<p>Types of windsurfing boards include freeride boards, which are built for mostly straight=line sailing and occasional turning, and wave boards, which are smaller and built for riding on and jumping breaking waves. IN 1984 windsurfing became an Olympic event.</p>

<h3 id="wind"> Wind Surfing</h3>

<p>Windsurfing is an extreme watersport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. The key equipment for windusrfing includes a board, mast, boom, and sail. The size of the board and sail may vary depending on the skill of the rider and weather conditions.</p>

<p>Types of windsurfing boards include freeride boards, which are built for mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning, and wave boards, which are smaller and built for riding on and jumping breaking waves. In 1984 windsurfing became an Olympic event. </p>

<h3 id="ice">Ice Climbing</h3>

<p>The sport of ice climbing involves ascending ice formations, including icefalls, frozen waterponds, and cliffs and rocks covered with ice. Ice climbers wear special shoes and use ice and ropes to make it to the top of ice structures.</p>

<p>The types of ice in ice climbing can be divided into two types: alpine ice and water ice. Alphine ice is formed by precipitation and is found on mountains. Water ice is formed by flowing water and is found on cliffs and beneath water flows. </p>

<h3 id="sky">Skydiving</h3>

<p>Skydiving involves exiting an aircraft or jumping off of a tall structure, and returning to the ground with an aid of a parachute. Andre-Jacques Garnerin made the first successful parachute jump from a hot air balloon in 1797. </p>

<p>Skydiving can begin at anywhere from 3,000 to 13,000 feet in altitude. At low altitudes, the parachute is deployed immediately. At higher altitudes, the skydiver may free-fall for a short period of time before opening the parachute.</p>
